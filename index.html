    <h1>Welcome to Seidu L.Yine-Nagb wedsite.</h1>
        <p>This wedsites educates student and the general public about the various natural  occurances<br>
        A natural disaster is the harmful impact of a natural hazard event on a vulnerable community.<br> 
        Learn about different types of natural hazards, how they affect people and the environment.<br>

    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO LANDSLIDES</h1>
    <p2>Landslides occur when gravitational and other types of shear stresses within a slope exceed the shear strength <br>
        (resistance to shearing) of the material  that form the slope.
        Also, it is the downward and outward movement of
        Soil, rock or vegetation under the influence of gravity<br>

        <h2>CAUSES OF LANDSLIDES</h2>
        <UL>
            <li>Earthquakes: Earthquakes occurs when the earth’s crust suddenly breaks and releases energy which <BR>
            leads to loose of rocks and soil which can trigger landslides  
            <li> Heavy rainfall: Heavy rainfall can saturate the ground causing debris flow, <BR>
                which is a type of landslide that involves flowing materials.
            <li> Human activities:  construction, deforestation, and mining can all contribute to landslides.
            </Ul>
            <h3>Types of land</h3>
            <p4><ul>
               <li>Rock fall : These happens when rocks break off a cliff face and fall down the hillside.
                <li>Debris Flow: Is a type of landslide that occurs when a mixture of water  and sediment, <br>
                    such as mud, rocks and vegetation moves rapidly down a slope often causing damage and loss of life.<br>
                     It can also be known as mudslides or debris floods which can occur in burn areas.<br>

                     <li>Slumps: It’s a type of landslide that occurs when a mass of rock or soil slides down a slope,<br>
                         often in a rotational motion. It is characterized by a distinct scrap(head scrap)at the top of the slope<br>
                          and a toe( foot) at the bottom of the slope. 
                    </li>
                </li>
               </ul>
            </p4>
            <h4>FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO LANDSLIDES</h4>
            <p4><ul>
                <li>GEOLOGICAL FACTORS 
                    Rock type and structure: Weak or fractured rock, such as shale or sandstone are more prone to landslides.
                    Slope angle and orientation: Steep slopes, especially those facing downhill are more susceptible to landslides.
                      </li>
                      <li> CLIMATIC FACTORS.
                        Drought and wildfires: Prolonged drought can weaken vegetation wile wildfires can alter soil properties increasing the rate of landslides.
                        Temperature Fluctuations: Extreme temperatures fluctuations can cause soil and rock to expand and contract leading to instability.
                         </li>
                         <li> HUMAN ACTIVITIES.
                            Deforestation and land use change: Removing vegetation can increase soil erosion and instability.
                            Mining and guarrying: Extracting minerals or rock can weaken soil leading to landslides      
                              </li>
                  </ul>
